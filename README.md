A student Registration System
This Student Registration System is a web application that allows users to register students by providing their name, ID, email, and contact details. The system includes the following functionalities:
1. Add Student: Users can input student details in the form fields and register them. The data is displayed dynamically on the page and stored in the browser's local storage for persistence, even after a page refresh.
2. Edit Student: Each student record includes an Edit button. When clicked, the details become editable inline. After editing, users can save the changes, which automatically update the displayed data and local storage.
3. Delete Student: A Delete button is available for each record, enabling users to remove a student. The record is deleted from both the page and local storage
This system provides a simple and efficient way to manage student data without relying on server-side infrastructure, making it ideal for small-scale applications or educationalÂ demonstrations.
